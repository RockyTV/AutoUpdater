AutoUpdater
===========

DarkMultiPlayer plugin that auto updates your server.



#### About

AutoUpdater is a [DarkMultiPlayer](http://github.com/godarklight/DarkMultiPlayer) addon (if you can call it like that), that periodically checks for new commits on the master branch, checks if any of the necessary DMP server files needs updating, and if they do need updating, it updates them.

The checks run every 30 minutes, and, if for some reason you can't contact godarklight's server, the program will exit.



#### Installation

Installation is simple. Just download the latest [release](https://github.com/RockyTV/AutoUpdater/releases), and extract the file to your server folder.
